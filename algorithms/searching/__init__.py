''' SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
These are used to find whether an element exists within list/array
In this file, here are the algorithms detailed:
1. Linear Search               |     Worst Case Run-time: O(n)
2. Iterative Binary Search     |     Worst Case Run-time: O(log n)
3. Recursive Binary Search     |     Worst Case Run-time:
