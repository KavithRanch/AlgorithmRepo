''' SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
These are used to find whether an element exists within list/array
In this file, here are the algorithms detailed:
1. Linear Search               |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: O(n)          |       Space-Complexity: 0(1)
2. Iterative Binary Search     |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: O(log n)      |       Space-Complexity: 0(1)
3. Recursive Binary Search     |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: 0(log n)      |       Space-Complexity: 0(log n)
