''' SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
These are used to find whether an element exists within list/array
In this file, here are the algorithms detailed:
1. Bubble Sort                 |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: O(n^2)          |       Space-Complexity: 0(1)
2. Insertion Sort              |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: O(n^2)          |       Space-Complexity: 0(1)
3. Selection Sort              |     Worst Case Time-Complexity: O(n^2)          |       Space-Complexity: 0(1)
